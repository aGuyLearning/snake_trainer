# Snake Trainer
A website to visualize the evolution of neural networks. I chose snake as the game, since it is nice and simple.

## Roadmap
  [ ] NEAT Algorithm from scratch
     [ ] Genomes
        [ ] crossover
        [ ] mutation
     [ ] Populations
        [ ] Speciation
     [ ] Parameter handeling
     [ ] Nodes
     [ ] Connections

In the end, i want a nice Stats overview, that get's updated with live data from the training cycles. 
Furthermore, you should be able to click on a specific 'Snake' and see its neurological build.

Have mercy with me
